Fingerprint Recognition Using Gabor Filter

Introduction
       Fingerprint recognition is a widely used biometric authentication technique in security systems, mobile devices, banking, and access control. The accuracy of a fingerprint recognition system mainly depends on the quality of the fingerprint image. Poor image quality caused by noise, low contrast, or broken ridges reduces recognition performance.
This project focuses on fingerprint image enhancement using Gabor filters, which improve ridge clarity and suppress noise, enabling accurate fingerprint feature extraction and matching.
